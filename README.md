## Summary

This project is fairly challenging as more than half of our class could not finished this on time and one other student dropped out. 

What I found really challenging was to style scss with 'forever overlaping... css' from RED-starter-theme or wordpress build-in IDs and Classes. It's an art of balancing the re-use ability and specificity. I have learned from this, is to do all the global and the least specific styling first.
